        <br>
Last updated: 6/28/15
<br>
<br>
Protecting your privacy is very important to Riqruit. We’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our website located at https://www.riqruit.com (the “Site”) and our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. So, please make sure that you have read and understand the Agreement. 
<br>
<br>
Revisions to this Privacy Policy
<br>
Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or some sort of notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective. 
<br>
<br>
Collection and Use of Information
<br>
Information Collected and/or Received from You 
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily use our Services. Also we may use your information to send you e-mails and materials that directly promote our Services. 
<br>
<br>
Customer Account Information
<br>
To use the Services as a Customer you’ll have to create an account (“Customer Account”). When you create an Account we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”), such as your name, email address and credit card information. We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. If you create an Account on behalf of an organization, we’ll also collect your organization’s corporate name, address and telephone number. We may use your PII to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.
<br>
<br>
Service Provider Account Information
<br>
In order to apply for a temporary position as a Service Provider at Riqruit, you’ll have to create an account (“Service Provider Account”). When you create a Service Provider Account we’ll collect certain PII, such as your name, email address and telephone number, and any other required additional information. We’ll use this information to contact you by telephone or email during the process of hiring. If we offer you a position at Riqruit, we or a third party service provider we work with, then we will collect additional PII and other information about you, such as your bank account details, your Social Security Number, profile photograph, description of your skills set and a short biography which may include your educational background (if applicable) and professional experience. We’ll post your name, photograph, biography and skills set to the Services and we’ll share this profile with Customers when we recommend you as a Service Provider to perform a Task request, or fill a job requisition, whether it be part, full time, or internship. In addition, we will use your phone number and email address to communicate with you and to forward various Tasks or job recommendations to you via email, text message, push notification or telephone call. 
<br>
<br>
(Customer Account and Service Provider Account together, the “Account”)
<br>
Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies. Like many website owners and operators, we may use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.
“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third party services providers that we may engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.
<br>
<br>
“Web Beacons” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) 
<br>
These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail). Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we may analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences.
<br>
<br>
Location Information
<br>
When you use our Services as a Customer or Service Provider, we may collect and store information about your location, for instance, by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to select Service Provider(s) who could perform those Tasks near to Customer location and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.
<br>
<br>
Information that We Share with Third Parties
<br>
We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:
Information shared with Service Providers. We share certain information about Customer Account holders with Service Providers so that they can effectively execute the Tasks and communicate with you if it is necessary. This information includes Customer Account holder’ name, organization’s corporate name and telephone number and location address. Service Provider(s) will be able to view, via the features of the Services, any rating other Service Provider(s) have given to you, as a Customer Account holder who has used the Services, what may include your name and organization’s corporate name.
<br>
<br>
Information shared with Customer
<br>
We share certain information about Service Provider Account holders with Customer so that Customer will be able to check if Service Provider has the required skills to perform a Task or fill a given job requisition. This information will include your name, photograph, biography and your skills set.
<br>
<br>
Information Shared with Third Party Services Providers<br>
We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. For example, we’ll share PII such as name, email address and telephone number with third party service providers who assist us with background checks.
<br>
<br>
Information Shared with Third Parties
<br>

Please exercise discretion and good judgment when making such comments and reviews and when rating.
<br>
<br>
Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions 
<br>
Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
<br>
<br>
Modifying Your Information
<br>
You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by using the features available on the Services. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at support@riqruit.com with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
<br>
<br>
Responding to Do Not Track Signals
<br>
Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers.
<br>
<br>
The Security of Your Information
<br>
We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
<br>
<br>
Links to Other Sites
<br>
Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.
<br>
<br>
International Transfer
<br>
Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.
<br>
<br>
Our Policy Toward Children 
<br>
